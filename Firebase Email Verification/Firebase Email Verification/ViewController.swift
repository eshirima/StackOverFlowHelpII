/****************************************** README: **********************************************

** FIRAuth.auth()?.currentUser -> This is what you can use to check if their currently exists a logged in user. This helps so as to avoid having the user log in everytime they launch your app. This info is saved in the iOS keychain by default by FIrebase
 
 ** This code isn't production ready. It is merely meant to be a guide on how to go about handling email verifications with Firebase. My advice is for you to learn more about Firebase first. Watch a couple YouTube videos so as you may get an idea of how it functions. Afterwards, take a shot at the issue and try solving it in your own way.
